5. On a scale from 0 to 5, 0 being the worst and 5 being the best, please rate the ease with which you were able to understand the computer’s spoken responses

## User’s point of view
By using this app, the input is limited because only the sentences that contains certain words like “life”,”love” will trigger result from the back end.  Sometimes its response make not much sense because it’s hard to catch user’s real intent.

## Developer’s point of view
Api.ai makes developing front end really fast and effective. We used flask and Python to build the backend of the app. We also used SQLAlchemy as a tool to bind tables to objects which helps a lot when programming the data.
